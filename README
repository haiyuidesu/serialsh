serialsh

> spawn a (reverse-)shell over a serial connection.

I. Requierements
	1. DCSD cable,
	2. serial terminal,
	3. jailbroken iOS device,
	4. XCode (xcrun & iphoneos SDK) + ldid2.

II. Notes
	> original project by @qwertyoruiopz,
	> once compiled, copy the the binary to /etc/rc.d/ on the device,
	> you can also get a shell-over-serial by setting the serial=3 boot-arg (alternative).

III. Issue
	> An issue is known where serialsh would not be able to start-up correctly.
	  A work around would be to pass serialsh as a deamon (/Library/LaunchDaemons/).
	  So if you really want to use it, please use the above method for the time being.

	  I apologize for the inconvenience.
