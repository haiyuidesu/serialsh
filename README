serialsh

> safety net against bootloop (reverse engineering session): spawn a shell over serial.

I. Requierements
	1. DCSD cable,
	2. serial terminal,
	3. jailbroken iOS device,
	4. basic compiling tools + ldid2.

II. Notes
	> original project by @qwertyoruiopz,
	> once compiled, copy the the binary to /etc/rc.d/ on the device.
	> with recents jailbreaks, you can replace serialsh by the serial=3 boot-arg.
	> it means that serialsh can be used up to iOS 12 (which need to be signed by signcert.p12).
